# Basic Site Template

This is the basic site template for Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS).

<img src="previews/site.png?raw=true" alt="Exotic site preview" width="50%">

It can serve as a starting point for resort owners to create a unique brand experience for their resort.

## Structure

* `files`: Folder with the UI kit XD file.
* `previews`: Folder with screenshots of the site template.
* `site`: Content package of the content that will be copied for each site created from this template (templates, pages, etc.).
* `theme`: Sources of the template theme to modify how the site looks (CSS, JS, etc.).
